## Competitive Analysis

- **Telegram**: Offers a built-in scheduled message feature that allows users to long-press the send button and choose a date and time. The UX is simple and efficient, making it ideal for users who want to plan messages in advance, such as birthday wishes or reminders.
- **Slack**: Slack provides advanced scheduling for both individual and group messages, with a full-featured date and time picker. It is widely used in professional settings to time announcements or updates during working hours, enhancing team communication.
- **WhatsApp**: Despite being one of the most widely used messaging platforms globally, WhatsApp currently lacks a native message scheduling feature. Users must rely on third-party apps or manual reminders, creating a clear opportunity to improve user convenience and boost engagement within the app.

Opportunity: Provide a secure, easy-to-use scheduling tool within WhatsApp.
