# WhatsApp Message Scheduler 
This case study proposes a feature enhancement for WhatsApp that enables users to schedule messages for future delivery perfect for birthdays, reminders, or promotional content. It includes user stories, roadmap, personas, backlog items, success metrics, and a competitive analysis to support the feasibility and user need for a built-in message scheduler within WhatsApp.



##  Key Features

-  **Schedule Messages**: Long-press the send button to schedule a message.
-  **Date & Time Picker**: Simple calendar interface to select delivery time.
-  **Auto Delivery**: Messages are delivered automatically, even if the app is closed.
-  **PM & Business Tools**: Useful for automating greetings or promotional campaigns.



##  Why This Feature?

- Users frequently miss out on time-sensitive messages (e.g., midnight birthday wishes).
- Competing platforms like Telegram and Slack offer message scheduling.
- WhatsApp currently lacks this, creating a user need and differentiation opportunity.
